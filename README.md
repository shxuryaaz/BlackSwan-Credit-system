# BlackSwan Credit Terminal

**CredTech Hackathon 2025 - Team BlackSwan**  
*(not really a team lol its just me)*

A real-time explainable credit intelligence platform that analyses creditworthiness assessment through AI-powered multi-source data pipelines, transparent scoring system(no blackbox), and interactive analytics.


## Project Overview

BlackSwan Credit Terminal addresses the critical limitations of traditional credit rating agencies by building a real-time credit intelligence system that:

- **Reacts faster than traditional ratings** through continuous data ingestion
- **Provides transparent explanations** without black-box methodologies  
- **Integrates multiple data sources** including structured financial data and unstructured news events
- **Delivers actionable insights** through an intuitive analyst dashboard

Traditional credit ratings are updated infrequently, based on opaque methodologies, and often lag behind real-world events. This platform transforms this by leveraging high-frequency, heterogeneous public data to create dynamic creditworthiness assessments that investors and regulators can trust because they understand the reasoning behind each score.



## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Tech Stack Selection & Rationale

Our architecture was carefully designed to meet the demanding requirements of real-time credit intelligence:

**Backend Framework**: **FastAPI** chosen for its:
- High-performance async capabilities (10x faster than Flask because speed matters when money's involved)
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Type safety with Pydantic models
- Native async/await support for concurrent data processing

**Data Processing**: **Celery + Redis** selected for:
- Distributed task processing across multiple workers
- Fault-tolerant message queuing
- Scalable background job execution
- Real-time event processing capabilities

**Database**: **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** combination provides:
- Time-series optimization for financial data 
- ACID compliance for data integrity (no oops we lost your credit score lol)
- Advanced indexing for fast queries
- Native JSON support for flexible schemas

**Frontend**: **Next.js 14 + TypeScript** chosen for:
- Server-side rendering for optimal performance
- Type safety across the entire stack
- Hot reload for rapid development
- Built-in optimization features

**Deployment**: **Docker + docker-compose** ensures:
- Consistent environments across development and production
- Easy scaling of individual services
- Simplified dependency management
- Reproducible deployments

### System Components

```

### Architecture Trade-offs Analysis

**Microservices vs Monolith**: We chose a service-oriented architecture with separate API, workers, and frontend services to enable:
- Independent scaling of components
- Technology flexibility for different services
- Fault isolation (worker failures don't affect API because Murphy's Law is real)
- **Trade-off**: Increased complexity vs better scalability and maintainability

**PostgreSQL vs NoSQL**: Selected PostgreSQL over MongoDB/Cassandra because:
- ACID transactions critical for financial data integrity
- Complex relational queries for credit analysis
- TimescaleDB extension provides time-series benefits
- **Trade-off**: Harder horizontal scaling vs better consistency and query capabilities

**Real-time vs Batch Processing**: Implemented hybrid approach:
- Real-time processing for news events and user interactions
- Batch processing for bulk financial data updates
- **Trade-off**: Higher complexity vs optimal performance for different data types
